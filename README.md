# sounds

Base to create a soundboard for anything.
Uses jQuery, Bootstrap, Animate.css, and FontAwesome.

- [Setup](#step-1)

### Todo

- [x] Badge the Sort All nav-item with the total sound count.
- [x] Show counts for each character's nav-items.
- [x] Dynamically create the nav-items for filtering.
- [ ] Populate the nav-items with characters based on how many sounds they have. The most popular characters will automatically be featured in the navbar.

### Step 1

---

Clone this repo and navigate to the assets/sounds folder.
Add your mp3 files to that folder.

### Step 2

---

Navigate to the assets/javascript folder and open 'app.js' in your code editor.
On line 7 you will see the class blueprint to layout your sound objects.

    class Sound {
      constructor(id, displayName, name, character, charId, audio) {
        this.id = id;
        this.displayName = displayName;
        this.name = name;
        this.character = character;
        this.charId = charId;
        this.audio = audio;
      }
    }

**_id_** = _number_ - The id of your sound. Go in order.

**_displayName_** = _string_ - The name you want displayed on the button to play your sound.

**_name_** = _string_ - The HTML value attribute that will be added to the button. **THIS MUST MATCH YOUR FILENAME**

**_character_** = _string_ - The name of the character to be displayed on the header ex: If this was a South Park soundboard we can say "Butters".

**_charId_** = _number_ - Determines whether the character will be featured in the navbar for sorting. Characters with a charId of 1-4 will be featured in the navbar **in that order** and badged to count the total sounds for each character.

**_audio_** = uses the JavaScript new Audio constructor for our mp3 file. Takes one argument which is the path our mp3 file.

Start by declaring new Sounds. This example uses South Park as a theme. See line 22 in "assets/javascript/app.js" for more details

    const sound1 = new Sound(
      1,
      "Please Don't Go",
      "pleasedontgo",
      "Butters",
      1,
      new Audio(`${path}pleasedontgo.mp3`)
    );

Next, add each sound variable to push them into the items array.

    items.push(sound1, sound2, sound3, sound4, ...)

### Step 3

---

Repeat Steps 1 and 2 every time you add more sounds (without cloning the repo of course). Test everything out and enjoy. It is mobile responsive and includes a dark theme. By default the page is loaded sorting the sounds in alphabetical order by character name. It also badges the card header with NEW for the last 10 sounds added. You can sort by newest sound added and play a random sound.
I'm sure there is a bug. Or 2 or 3, but it does work. Enjoy!
